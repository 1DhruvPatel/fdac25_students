I am Amy Huang and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Machine Learning at UTK. I have worked with the university's Civil and Environmental Engineering department as an undergraduate research assistant since Spring 2023. I have also interned for two summers at International Paper and worked briefly with the national labs for HPC bootcamps. My interests are in machine learning, programming, and data science. Data plays a crucial role in machine learning, so I am excited to learm more about recognizing poor quality data and how to clean it up to create better models.
