I am Advait Joshi and I am a Masterâ€™s student in the Computer Science department at UTK. 
My background includes working on projects in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and large language models.
I am interested in applying AI to real-world applications and hope to improve my skills in collaborative software development, version control, and open-source contributions through this course.
