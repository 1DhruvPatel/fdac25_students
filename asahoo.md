I am Anant Sahoo, and I am a senior majoring in Honors Computer Science with minors in Data Science and Machine Learning. Originally from Franklin, Tennessee, I have a strong passion for learning and am particularly drawn to the intersection of data science and machine learning. I am eager to deepen my understanding of data curation and extraction techniques, as I believe these are essential foundations for data engineering and critical precursors in building robust machine learning pipelines.
