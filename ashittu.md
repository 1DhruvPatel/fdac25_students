My name is Abubakar Sadiq Shittu. I am a PhD student with strong interests in cryptographic key management and authentication systems. My current research explores how to make commit signing a standard practice in distributed version control systems such as Git. Specifically, I am interested in measuring the prevalence of commit signing in the wild, understanding how developers handle the task, and identifying the key pain points they face. I plan to address these questions through both measurement studies and user studies. For this course, I hope to strengthen my practical skills in data collection and analysis, which will be essential for achieving my research goals.
