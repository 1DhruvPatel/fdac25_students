I am Brigitte Turner and I am working on my Master's degree in Computer Science at UTK. I graduated from Freed-Hardeman University in May 2025 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and interned at Oak Ridge National Lab during the summers of 2023 and 2024. I like math and coding and I'm especially interested in eco-friendly computing methods.
