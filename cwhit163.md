My name is Chris White and I am a grad student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I have also been an assistent researcher at TENNLab for the past year. I enjoy coding in C, C++, and Rust, as well as researching spiking neural networks. I look forward to learning how to properly gather and analyze data as well as properly handle data!
