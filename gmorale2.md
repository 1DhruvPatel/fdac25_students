I am Grecia-Melany Juan Morales, and I'm a senior in computer science. I like to play games and go fishing. I'd like to be able to apply what I've learned in fields not commonly associated with computer science such as wildlife research.  I hope to learn about data analysis and get more experience with handling it in this course.
