I am Grecia-Melany Juan Morales, and I'm a senior in computer science. I don't have much experience, but I'm very open to learning things and want to gain experience and exposure to as many fields as possible. I'd like to be able to apply what I've learned in fields not commonly associated with computer science such as wildlife research. I hope to learn about data analysis and get more experience with handling it in this course.
