# Hadi Bhidya

My name is Hadi Bhidya, and I am currently a senior at UTK. Over the past few years, I have gained valuable experience through internships at Pilot Flying J, Trimble, and RDI Technologies. My main passion lies in data science, particularly in leveraging machine learning and large language models to transform chaotic, unstructured data into meaningful, structured insights. I am eager to further develop these technical skills and apply them to areas I care about, such as food science, addressing food insecurity, improving transit systems, and creating urban density. Through this course, I hope to deepen my understanding of advanced data techniques and discover new ways to integrate them with my broader interests to make an impact.
