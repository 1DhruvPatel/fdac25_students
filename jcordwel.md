Hi, my name is John. I'm a senior studying computer science, and I'm interested in AI, HPC, embedded systems, and low-level optimizations. I'm looking to learn about data collection and cleaning, and my goal is to capitalize on that knowledge for my own personal AI projects. Suprisingly, I haven't collected data for a project in any of my classes, so thinking and working with data is new to me. I'm excited to learn about the human/behavioral variables reflected in data.
