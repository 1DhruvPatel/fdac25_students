My name is Julianna Prater, and I'm a senior in computer science. Additionally, I'm completing a minor in cybersecurity. By taking this course, I hope to gain a better understanding of how data is collected and used to help improve my security mindset and recognize and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in relation to data privacy.
