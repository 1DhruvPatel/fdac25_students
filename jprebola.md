My name is Justin Prebola and I'm a senior undergraduate student in computer science. I enjoy coding, playing video games, and listening to music. I hope to gain
a better understanding of data analysis and cleaning from this course. Digital archeology is not something I know much about, but I hear a lot about data analysis
as a growing field. I thought it would be useful to have at least a little understanding of it.
