I am Jackson Weil and I am a first semester Masters student here at UT. I recently completed my undergraduate degree in computer science here. I am originally from Nashville, and I am interested broadly in machine learning, but my favorite sub-discipline is reinforcement learning after learning a little about Atari game bots, the AlphaGo engine that beat the South Korean Go champion, and learning about (semi-)autonomous cars like those of Waymo, Tesla, and Wayve. My hobbies include tennis, basketball, and videogames (mainly Rocket League at the moment). A personal goal I'd like to accomplish by the end of 2025 is to dunk a basketball.

In this class, I would like to learn generally how to understand and curate data better. To get more specific, I would love to work with sports data (maybe basketball, tennis, or soccer) and perhaps find a way to curate that data and apply some method (likely ML-based) to draw insights from said data. Maybe this could mean advising a coach's play calls based on past outcomes or drafting certain fantasy sports players based on past outcomes or trends. Another interesting data source to me is sensory data from autonomous vehicles - there is a wealth of this kind of data and a high demand for finding what is important from the sea of sensory data and using said data to train RL agents or LLMs to further the autonomy mission.
