I am Luke Farthing and I am a second year master's student. I was born and raised in Harrisburg, NC (near Charlotte) and moved to Tennesse for work. I have worked as a Computer Engineer in Oak Ridge for just under 2 years. I was drawn to coding because, to me, it is more like solving a puzzle. SOlving the puzzle of a software program is always satisfying and is just as exciting to me today as it was when I first coded in high school. My hope for this class is that I learn how to better process data and extract meaning from it, which will assist me in my current position.
