# Mikkayla Byest

I am majoring in Neuroscience and Computer Science, and I am on a pre-med track. 
I want to learn how to better use data science and AI tools to solve real-world problems, 
especially in healthcare and biology. My goal is to strengthen my programming 
and data analysis skills so I can apply them in both medical research and technology.
