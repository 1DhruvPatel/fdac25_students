I am Minh Cao and I am a senior studying Computer Science. Taking this course I hope to be able to expand my knowledge base and get all I can with database analysis. I hope to learn how to better use data in my code writting. Some on my interests are Volleyball, Lacrosse, Raving, Photography, and Cinematography.
