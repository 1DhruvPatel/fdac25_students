I am Mia Patrikios, and I am a senior studying Computer Science with a minor in Machine Learning. I have eperience in web development, data analysis, and test automation. Iâ€™m especially interested in data visualization and finding patterns in how people think and behave. I think data visualization is the best way to turn data into stories that help us understand the world better.
