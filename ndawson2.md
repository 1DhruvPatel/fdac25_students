I'm Nic Dawson, a Senior in computer science with an interest in robotics and game development. I've contributed to several Godot-based games, and have mentored for FIRST Robotics team 4504. In this class, I'm looking forward to learning how to clean and process sensor data and how it can be applied to robotics.
