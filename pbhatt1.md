I am Prapti Bhatt, first year graduate student in the Computer Science Department. My interests are in the intersection of AI/ML and healthcare. I wanted to analysis and find biases in the healthcare or medical data. Additionally, I would like to explore on the law-related datasets if given the opportunity.
