Name: Raj Dhyaneshvar Chennai Jayamoorthy

I’m pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science with focus on Intelligent Systems and Machine Learning. 
I’m interested in bio-inspired computation, computer vision, and applications of AI in healthcare. 
From this course, I hope to strengthen my knowledge of distributed data systems and learn ethical ways to scrape data.
