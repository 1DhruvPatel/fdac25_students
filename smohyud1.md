I am Sulaiman Mohyuddin, but my preferred name is Sully. I'm a Senior Computer Science student with primarily Full-Stack development experience. I took this class to explore data in general and, hopefully, find a more specific topic to focus on. Right now, I am leaning towards learning how to store and retrieve big data efficiently.
