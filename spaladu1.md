### Introduction

Hi! I am Valli Paladugu, a senior in Computer Science with a minor in Machine Learning. Some of my hobbies outside of academia are baking, listening/editing music, and dancing. I have done two internships in the past, one at Siemens Healthineers and I am been working at Knoxville Utility Board since the start of the summer. The reason why I am taking this class is because I want to learn how to do proper data collection and manage it properly. I have done two projects in the past were it would have been helpful to know how to search for, collect and use appropriate data.
