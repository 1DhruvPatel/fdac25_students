I am Sean Ward, a senior in COSC. I am interested in this course becuase I want to learn how to manipulate, understand and prepare data to get the best results when training and deploying ML models. I have lots of experience with this subject when it comes to Computer Vision but would like to learn more about analyzing and handling textual data.
