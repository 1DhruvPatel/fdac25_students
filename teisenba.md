I am Trevor Eisenbacher and I am a student studying computer science, which resides within the EECS department. I have worked at the BCMB both as an office assistant and undergrad research assistant, and over the summer at Amcor as a Quality Management Systems Data Analyst Intern. I like solving problems by diving deep into the data behind them and understanding exactly how that a system works. Besides all of that, I enjoy being outdoors, staying active, and meeting new people. I'd like to learn how to transform data of poor quality into data good enough for advance, useful analysis.
