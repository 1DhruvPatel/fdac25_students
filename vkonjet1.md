I am Vineeth Konjeti, a first-year graduate student in Computer Science with a strong interest in developing my skills in machine learning.
I don't have a specific research interest, but I am interested in computer vision, NLPs, and I am eager to explore further into data analytics, 
since it can provide useful insights and support better decision-making. Through exploring these fields, I hope to find my research direction, 
work on impactful projects, and build skills that will help me in my career.
