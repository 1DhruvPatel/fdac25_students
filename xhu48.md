Hi! This is Hu,Xinyu. I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Civil Engineering and Environment Department. I'm currently working on a project that involves collecting free-text data from online platforms like Reddit and comparing it with the Department of Transportation's (DOT) survey data. The goal is to get a better understanding of public sentiment toward the DOT with a more accurate ground truth.



I don't have a clear understanding of what "fundamentals of Digital Archaeology" explicitly refers to. However, after reading the course description on the GitHub page, I found it very interesting. I previously worked on a gaze collection project on the iOS platform and currently maintain my own AWS cloud server and a school server for my research. I hope these skills will be beneficial for my studies.
